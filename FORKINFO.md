This is a fork of great work by Andre Jilderda where my version share slightly different features:

- The notification is disabled
- When inserting a bullet you can use `*`, `-`, or `–` and it will always save in Harvest as a `•`

# Tagging

While upstream tags will be maintained, my tags will iterate on the latest releast of the fork and will always feature build meta, e.g. `X.X.X+aubreypwd.X`, and so the format will be:

```
X.X.X+aubreypwd.Y
```

Where `Y` will be iterated in a numerical form. My releases will follow only that tags I add, not the upstream's.
